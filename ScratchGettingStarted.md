## Getting Started

Congratulations on getting started with Scratch. Scratch is a block based online coding language that easily allows you to create all sorts of fun programs with code blocks. Code blocks are great for beginners because you are able to drag and drop different code blocks and link them together without ever having to worry about syntax rules. You'll have all the advantages of learning different programming concepts without the frustration of having to worry about the correct way to type out a specific piece of code. You'll just drag, drop, and connect. Okay, maybe I over simplify a bit, but its not too far off though.

I'm going to guess that if you're here, you already have a Scratch account and are ready to create your first project. To do that, click on the "Create" button in the type menu bar.
